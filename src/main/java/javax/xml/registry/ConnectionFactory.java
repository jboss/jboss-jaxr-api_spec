/** This is the abstract base class for factory classes for creating a JAXR
 * connection. A JAXR ConnectionFactory object is configured in a
 * provider-specific way to create connections with registry providers.
 * 
 * Looking Up a ConnectionFactory Using the JNDI API
 * The preferred way for a client to look up a JAXR ConnectionFactory is within
 * the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. A ConnectionFactory
 * object is registered with a naming service in a provider specific way, such
 * as one based on the JNDI API. This registration associates the
 * ConnectionFactory object with a logical name. When an application wants to
 * establish a connection with the provider associated with that
 * ConnectionFactory object, it does a lookup, providing the logical name.
 * The application can then use the ConnectionFactory object that is returned
 * to create a connection to the messaging provider.
 * 
 * Looking Up a ConnectionFactory Without Using the JNDI API
 * The JAXR API provides an alternative way to look up a JAXR ConnectionFactory
 * that does not require the use of the JNDI API. This is done using the
 * newInstance static method on the abstract class ConnectionFactory provided
 * in the JAXR API. The newInstance method returns a JAXR ConnectionFactory.
 * The client may indicate which factory class should be instantiated by the
 * newInstance method by defining the system property
 * javax.xml.registry.ConnectionFactoryClass. If this property is not set,
 * the JAXR provider must return a default ConnectionFactory instance.
